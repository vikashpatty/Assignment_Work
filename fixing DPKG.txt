First run:

lsof /var/lib/dpkg/lock
Then make sure that process isn't running:

ps cax | grep PID
If it is running:

kill PID
#wait
kill -9 PID
Make sure process is done:

ps cax | grep PID
Then remove the lock file:

sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock
Let dpkg fix itself:

sudo dpkg --configure -a
You should be fine afterwards :)
