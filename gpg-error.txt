Go to the OpenPGP Public Key Server. There you can enter your key into the Search String field, leaving everything else as is, then click "Search!".
When searching for a key, always prepend 0x to it! This means that, for example, you have to search for 0x6AF0E1940624A220 instead of 6AF0E1940624A220.
Click on the link provided in the pub section. This should take you to page containing the key. The page's heading should be similar to Public Key Server -- Get "0x6AF0E1940624A220"
Copy everything from underneath the title (starting from -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----) and save it in a file (e.g. key1).
Once you have the file, run the following command
sudo apt-key add key1
